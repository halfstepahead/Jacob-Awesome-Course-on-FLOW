Chapter 1 - Day 1 - Learning Blockchain Concepts

1.	Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 

Blockchain is an open, decentralized, shared database that allows anyone to store stuff publically. Anyone can interact with it with approval and it belongs to nobody that everyone can store information or view the data on it. 

2.	Explain what a Smart Contract is. 

Smart Contracts are programs, or "rulebooks" that developers make that users can interact with according to a pre-set rules that nobody can change it or play the other way around it, unless it’s designed to be allowed since day 1. 

3.	Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

A script does not cost any money and it won’t change the data on blockchain but only view it; A transaction does involve fee(gas fee) and change data on blockchain.
